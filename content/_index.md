  title: "The Future of Work"
  content: "Accelerated by the pandemic, but responsive to the modern enterprise’s needs, it’s clear to us that the future of work is increasingly contingent-focused. These employees are generally termed contractors, freelancers, consultants, temps, or other non-employee, non-exempt worker types, and they’re absolutely critical to optimizing your workforce spend and output. 
  
  <br><br>
  In 2023, contingent workers make up at least 40% of the labor force – and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2030.  Are your total talent management systems and processes ready for this reality? Most software and established processes take into account only traditional, FTE resourcing plans.
